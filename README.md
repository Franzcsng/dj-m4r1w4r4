First React.js Project. 

Initially started this project to explore and start up my React.Js framework journey. The project was originally a static website portfolio for DJ M4R1W4R4, but along the way, I decided to maximize my learnings
and experience with this project by turning it into a dynamix website, with backend APIs that fetches data from a database.
